# Projects-Ideas: A Project management/organisation App for macOS and iOS (iPad)

by Dominik Stücheli

This App was developed as a Matura Project in Switzerland.
It works in a similar principle as for example Trello or Notions project planner, but always keeps content in the main view; There are no deeper menus. To use screen space efficiently, content can be minimized to its title. All text is editable in the main view. The point is to never "lose" or forget that content exists as a user, which I think to be the case in the Notion project planner, which was the main motivation for this project.
